# NetworkcloakerPROTOTYPE
DISCLAIMER: This is A prototype of a network cloaker. THIS DOES NOT INTERACT WITH YOUR ISP OR CLOAK YOUR ACTIVITY, THIS IS A SIMULATION! This is a simulation of randomized network traffic and neveer actually changes anything.
When ran, this does not encrypt or tunnel any of your traffic like a VPN or using TOR, it simply simulates entropy in network traffic
I plan on eventually making a real network cloaker that actually encrypts, but this is a simulation and basic version that fits into a single file instead of multiple distributed files.
